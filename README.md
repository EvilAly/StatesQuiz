# StatesQuiz
Extending Java II assignment into full State Quiz App

I thought this project would be a good idea to help my son study states when he started working on them in school. This is a slow work in progress as I only get to work on it during down time. 

Version 1 - Assignment as turned in.

Version 2 - Hardcoded states and capitals into program.

Version 3 - Changed from asking if user wants to continue after each state to asking how many states to test at the beginning of the program.

Version 4 - Working on removing duplicates so user does not get the same state twice.
